# AyoKrishi - Connect

AyoKrishi - Connect is a chat application module designed exclusively for AyoKrishi - WebForum, a platform dedicated to sharing knowledge among farmers. This application leverages WebSocket with Socket.io and Node.js to provide real-time chat functionality.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time chat interface.
- Responsive design adaptable to various devices.
- Chat data is not stored at the moment due to the statelessness of WebSocket.
- Future updates will implement database connectivity for chat history storage.

## 🌐 Deployment

AyoKrishi - Connect is currently deployed on [Render](https://ayokrishi-connect-test-2.onrender.com/). 
You can access and test the application through this link.
